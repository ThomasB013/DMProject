This is my code for the datamining project in the second year.

I implemented my own matrix and vector as an exercise.

The code uses linear regression to make a confidence intervals around a best fit curve.
These are then used to remove outliers. See the pdf, 4.2 and 4.3 for an impression of the functionality.
